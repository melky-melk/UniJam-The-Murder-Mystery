# UniJam-The-Murder-Mystery

'UniJam: The Video Game' (Working Title, alternative suggestion is 'UniJam: A Murder Mystery) is a video game based on the University of Sydney's Jamming Society, set in said University.
A USYD Student named Jamie under the advice of his older sister Eunie joins UniJam, the Sydney University's Jamming Society. 

He enjoys his times at the jam but can't help but notice a certain tension. As he begins to get accustomed to jamming with everyone, Eunie abruptly dies from what seems to be an accident, but clues seem to suggest otherwise... Traumatised and in denial of her death, Jamie starts to investigate, until he's suddenly killed himself anonymously by someone who doesn't want him to find out the truth. Though Jamie restarts back to several days before Eunie is killed, and realises he's able to loop back to this exact day every morning. With the ability to loop, he's now determined to prevent the death of Eunie and catch the murderer.

We are currently working on making this ambitious visual novel :)
